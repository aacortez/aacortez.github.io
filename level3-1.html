        <li>i always get myself into this mess</li>

        <li>i always jump thinking he will catch me at the fall </li>
        <span><li>i am hopelessly a lover and a dreamer that will be the death of me</li> 
        <li>you said if it is meant to be fate will bring us back together.</li> 
        <li>for a second i wonder if you are really that naive.</li> 
        <li>if you really believe fate works like that. </li>
        <li>as if it lives in the sky staring down at us. as if it has five fingers and spends its time placing us like pieces of chess. </li></span>
        <li>as if it is not the choices we make.</li> 
        <li>who taught you that.</li> 
        <li>tell me who convinced you.</li> 
        <span><li>you've been given a heart and a mind that isn't yours to use.</li> 
        <li>that your actions do not define what will become of you.</li> 
        <li>i want to scream and shout it's us you fool.</li></span>
        <li>we're the only ones that can bring us back together.</li>
        <li>but instead i sit quietly.</li> 
        <li>smiling softly through quivering lips thinking.</li> 
        <li>isn't it such a tragic thing.</li> 
        <li>when you can see it so clearly but the other person doesn't.</li>
