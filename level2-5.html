    <ol>
        <li>i always get myself into this mess</li>
        <li>i always let him tell me i am beautiful and half
    believe it </li>
        <li>i always jump thinking he will catch me at the fall </li>
        <li>i am hopelessly a lover and a dreamer that will be the death of me</li> 
        <li>you said if it is meant to be fate will bring us back together.</li> 
        <li>for a second i wonder if you are really that naive.</li> 
        <li>if you really believe fate works like that. </li>
        <li>as if it lives in the sky staring down at us. as if it has five fingers and spends its time placing us like pieces of chess. </li>
        <li>as if it is not the choices we make.</li> 
        <li>who taught you that.</li> 
        <li>tell me who convinced you.</li> 
        <li>you've been given a heart and a mind that isn't yours to use.</li> 
        <li>that your actions do not define what will become of you.</li> 
        <li>i want to scream and shout it's us you fool.</li>
        <li>we're the only ones that can bring us back together.</li>
        <li>but instead i sit quietly.</li> 
        <li>smiling softly through quivering lips thinking.</li> 
        <li>isn't it such a tragic thing.</li> 
        <li>when you can see it so clearly but the other person doesn't.</li>

    <em><h1>don't mistake salt for sugar if he wants to be with you he will its that simple he only whispers i love you as he slips his hands down the waistband of you pants this is where you must understand the difference between want and need you may want that boybu but you certainly dont need him you were temptingly beautiful but stung when i got close</h1></em>
