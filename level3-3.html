believe it i always jump thinking he will
    catch me at the fall i am hopelessly a lover and a dreamer that will be the death of
    me you said. if it is meant to be fate will
    bring us back together. for a second i wonder if you are really that naive. if you really believe fate works like that. as if it li
    ves in the sky staring down at us. as if it has five fingers and spends its timeplacing us like piees of chess. as if it is not the
    choices we make. who taught you that. tell me. who convinced you. you've been given a heart and a mind that isn't yours to
    use. that your actions do not define what will become of you. i want to scream and shout it's us you fool. we're the only ones 
    that can bring us back together. but instead i sit quietly. smiling softly through quivering lips thinking. isn't it such a tragic
    thing. when you can see it so clearly but the other person doesn't. don't mistake salt for sugar if he wants to be with you he will its that simple he only whispers i love you as he slips his hands down thew waist band of you pants this is where you
    must understand the difference between want and need you may want that boybu but you certainly dont need him
you wer
