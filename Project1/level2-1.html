m tell me i am beautiful <br>
half believe it i always jump thinking he will catch me at the fall i am hopelessly a lover and a dreamer that will be the death of me 
you said. if it is meant to be fate will bring us back together. for a second i wonder if you are really that naive. if you really believe fate works like that. as if it lives in the sky staring down at us. as if it has five fingers and spends its time placing us like piees of chess. as if it is not the choices we make. who taught you that. tell me. who convinced you. you've been given a heart and a mind that isn't yours to use. that your actions do not define what will become of you. i want to scream and shout it's us you fool. we're the only ones that can bring us back together. but instead i sit quietly. smiling softly through quivering lips thinking. isn't it such a tragic thing. when you can see it so clearly but the other person doesn't. 
don't mistake saft for sugar if he wants to be with you he will its that simple
he only whispers i love you as he slips his hands down the waistband of you pants this is where you must understand the difference between want and need you may want that boy but you certainly dont need him
you were temptingly beautiful but stung when i got close
the next time you have your coffee black you'll taste the bitter state he left you in it will make you weep but you'll never stop drinking you'd rather have the darkest parts of him than have nothing 
you have spent enough nights with his manhood curled inside your legs to forget what loneliness feels like
you whisper i love you what you mean is i dont want you to leave
that's the thing about love it marinates your lips till the only word your mouth remembers is his name
i didnt leave you because i stopped loving you i left because the longer i stayed the less i loved myself
did you think i was a city big enough for a weekend getaway i am the town surrounding it the one you've never heard of but always pass through there are no neon lights here no skyscrapers or statues but there is thunder for i make bridges tremble i am not street meat i am homemade jam thick enough to cut the sweetest thing your lips touch i am not police sirens i am the crackle of a fireplace i'd burn you and you still couldn't take your eyes off me cause i'd look so beautiful doing it you'd blush i am not a hotel room i am home i am not whiskey you want i am the water you need dont come here with expectations and try to make a vacation out of me
