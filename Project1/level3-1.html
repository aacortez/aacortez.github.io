                    i always get myself into this mess i always let him tell me i am beautiful and half believe it i always jump thinking he will catch me at the fall i am hopelessly a lover and a dreamer that will be the death of me you said. if it is meant to be fate will bring us back together. for a second i wonder if you are really that naive. if you really believe fate works like that. as if it lives in the sky staring down at us. as if it has five fingers and spends its timeplacin g us like piees of chess. as if it is not the choices we make. who taught you that. tell me. who convinced you. you've beengiven a heart and a mind that isn't yours to use. that your actions do not define what will become of you. i want to screamandshout it's us you fool. we're the only ones that can bring us back together. but instead i sit quietly. smiling softly through quivering lips thinking. isn't it such a tragic thing.
