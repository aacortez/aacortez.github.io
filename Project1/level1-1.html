i always get myself into this mess i always let him tell me i am beautiful and half<br>
believe it i always jump thinking he will<br>
    catch me at the fall i am hopelessly a lover and a dreamer that will be the deathof<br>
    me you said. if it is meant to be fate will<br>
    bring us back together. for a second i wonder if you are really that naive. if youre<br> ally believe fate works like that. as if it li<br>
    ves in the sky staring down at us. as if it has five fingers and spends its timeplacin<br> g us like piees of chess. as if it is not the<br>
    choices we make. who taught you that. tell me. who convinced you. you've beeng<br>iven a heart and a mind that isn't yours to<br>
    use. that your actions do not define what will become of you. i want to screamand<br> shout it's us you fool. we'rethe only ones <br>
    that can bring us back together. but instead i sit quietly. smiling softly throughqui<br> vering lips thinking. isn't it such a tragic<br>
    thing. when you can see it so clearly but the other person doesn't. don't mistakesa<br> alt for sugar if he wants to be with you h<br>
    e will its that simple he only whispers i love you as he slips his hands down thew<br> waistband of you pants this is where you<br>
    must understand the difference between want and need you may want that boybu<br> but you certainly dont need him
you wer<br>
    e temptingly beautiful but stung when i got close
the next time you have yourcoff<br> coffee black you'll taste the bitter state he<br>
    left you in it will make you weep but you'll never stop drinking you'd rather have<br> the darkest parts of him than have nothin<br>
    g you have spent enough nights with his manhood curled inside your legs toforge<br> forget what loneliness feels like you whis<br>
    per i love you what you mean is i dont want you to leave
that's the thing aboutlov<br> love it marinates your lips till the only wo<br>
    rd your mouth remembers is his name i didnt leave you because i stopped loving<br> you i left because the longer i stayed the le<br>
    ss i loved myself
did you think i was a city big enough for a weekend getaway ia<br> am the town surrounding it the one you've<br>
    never heard of but always pass through there are no neon lights here no skyscrap<br> skyscrapers or statues but there is thunder<br>
    for i make bridges tremble i am not street meat i am homemade jam thick enough<br> to cut the sweetest thing your lips touch i<br>
    am not police sirens i am the crackle of a fireplace i'd burn you and you still coul<br> dn't take your eyes off me cause i'd look s<br>
    o beautiful doing it you'd blush i am not a hotel room i am home i am notwhiskey<br> you want i am the water you need dont co<br>
    me here with expectations and try to make a vacation out of me because i am not
