        <p>i always get <br>
            myself into this mess <br>
            i always let him tell me i am <br>
            beautiful and half believe it i always<br>
            jump thinking he will catch me at the fall i am<br>
            <strong>hope</strong>lessly a lover and a dreamer that will be the death <br>
            <strong>of me you said.</strong> if it is meant to be fate will bring us back <br>
            <strong>together. for a second i wonder if you are really that naive.</strong> <br>
            <strong>if you really believe fate works like that. as if it</strong> lives in <br>
            <strong>the sky staring down at us.</strong> as if it has five fing<br>
            <strong>ers and spends its time</strong> placing us like pieces<br>
            <strong>of chess. as if it is not</strong> the choices we make.<br>
            <strong>who taught you that.</strong> tell me. who conv<br>
           <strong>inced you. you've</strong> been given a heart<br>
            <strong>and a mind that</strong> isn't yours to use.<br>
            <strong>that your act</strong>ions do not define<br>
            what will become of you. i <br>
            want to scream and shout <br>
            it's us you fool. we're <br>
            the only ones that  <br>
            can bring us <br>
            back tog<br>

            but instead i sit quietly. smiling softly through quivering lips thinking. isn't it such a tragic thing. when you can see it so clearly but the other person doesn't. don't mistake salt for sugar if he wants to be with you he will its that simple he only whispers i love you as he slips his hands down thew waist band of you pants this is where you must understand the difference between want and need you may want that boy but you certainly dont need him you were temptingly beautiful but stung when i got close the next time you have yourcof coffee black you'll taste the bitter state he left you in it will make you weep but you'll never stop drinking you'd rather have the darkest parts of him than have nothing you have spent enough nights with his manhood curled inside your legs toforge forget what loneliness feels like you whisper i love you what you mean is i dont want you to leave that's the thing aboutlovlove it marinates your lips till the only word your mouth remembers is his name i didnt leave you because i stopped lovingyou i left because the longer i stayed the less i loved myself did you think i was a city big enough for a weekend getaway i am the town surrounding it the one you've never heard of but always pass through there are no neon lights here no skyscrapskyscrapers or statue but there is thunder for i make bridges tremble i am not street meat i am homemade jam thick enough to cut the sweetest thing your lips touch i am not police sirens i am the crackle of a fireplace i'd burn you and you still couldn't take your eyes off me cause i'd look so beautiful doing it you'd blush i am not a hotel room i am home i am notwhiskey you want i am the water you need dont come here with expectations and try to make a vacation out of me because i am not
